# Introduction
The 2021 Marketing Performance Dashboard project provides end-to-end analysis of digital marketing campaigns using Excel’s Power Query, Power Pivot, and Pivot Tables.

# Data Preparation
Imported datasets of about *17 columns* and **200,000 rows** from Excel as a CSV file.


## Data Cleaning in Power Query
Removed nulls and duplicates.
Normalized text and corrected data types (numbers, currency, percentages, dates).
Ensured acquisition cost values were consistent and rounded.
